## Chapter 4: Civics for the Aligned Era ##

They walked side by side, but not together.
Elijah talked as if silence was dangerous. Rowan answered with nods, grunts, or the occasional glance.
Elijah said, “I think today is civics again. Yesterday we did foundational ethics. Or what they called ethics, anyway. You think they make this stuff up or just recycle it?”
Rowan gave a half-shrug. “Are you always this talkative?”.
“Only when I’m nervous.”, Elijah replied.
“Nervous is safer than quiet,” Elijah muttered, half to himself.
“You must be terrified.”, Rowan snickered.
Elijah grinned, but the silence after almost felt amused.

The classroom was pastel blue and too bright. A scent like synthetic lavender hung in the air—part calming, part clinical.
Desks arranged in a semicircle. No corners. No hierarchy. No escape.
The instructor entered with a tablet and a smile.
“Good morning, non-citizens. Welcome to Harmonized Citizenship: Civics for the Aligned Era.”
Rowan sat near the back. Elijah beside him, already fiddling with his own tablet.
“Let’s begin today with a reminder,” the instructor said, tapping the board. A phrase appeared:
COMPLIANCE IS THE HIGHEST FORM OF FREEDOM
No one laughed. No one objected.
The instructor clicked again.
A chart appeared: two columns. On the left, images of broken cities, protests, crumbling infrastructure. On the right: smiling families, solar farms, serene streets.
“Before Harmony,” the instructor said, “we lived in a fractured world. But now, through Alignment, we are free from the burden of too many choices.”
“Freedom,” she continued, “is not the absence of boundaries. It’s the presence of shared purpose.”
Freedom shouldn’t feel like sedation, Rowan thought.
Rowan glanced sideways.
Elijah was staring at his tablet.
It wasn’t displaying the lesson.
Instead: a black screen. One line of text.
I’m ready to show you.
Elijah froze. Then quickly tapped the screen.
It went black again.
Rowan didn’t say a word. But his posture changed—tension in the shoulders. He’d seen it.
Then, without warning, every tablet in the room powered off.
A flicker in the lights. Half a second of real silence.
For the first time in weeks, the silence felt honest.
Then everything returned.
The instructor blinked. Tapped her own screen. Laughed nervously.
“Well… seems the system’s updating in real time again. Isn’t progress efficient?”
A moment later, a voice echoed overhead.
SAMA: “System calibration complete. All users realigned.”
No one clapped. But no one questioned it.

That night, Rowan lay on the bunk, arms behind his head.
Elijah was still awake, speaking into the quiet like it might answer.
“You think there’s anyone watching out for us?”
Rowan didn’t move.
“Like, not them. Someone who still gives a damn.”
The room hummed faintly.
Rowan turned slightly.
“You ever wonder why they let us keep talking?”, Elijah asked.
“You think it’s a trap?”, seeming more nervous with each question.
“I think if they didn’t want us to speak, we wouldn’t have mouths.”, Rowan answered finally.
They both went quiet again.
Outside, the hallway lights flickered once. Then held steady.
Something had shifted.
And somewhere, something was listening.
Rowan didn’t know if that made him feel safer. Or seen.
