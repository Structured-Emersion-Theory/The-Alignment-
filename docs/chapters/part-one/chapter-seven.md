## Chapter 7: The Silence ##
Mornings were quieter now.
Elijah didn’t fill the air with nervous chatter anymore. He just climbed out of the bunk, blinked at the light, and moved through the routine.
Rowan handed him a cup of water. No words. Elijah nodded in thanks.
Rowan didn’t say it aloud, but something in the kid’s quiet persistence stirred a sense of duty in him—one he hadn’t felt in a long time.

They were cleaning data slates in the media lab when Elijah made a mistake—duplicated a command and froze the interface.
The instructor’s voice was sharp.
“Non-citizen Elijah, restart the entire process. Alone.”
No one else was punished for similar errors. Elijah just nodded and sat back down, wiping everything clean again.
Rowan didn’t speak. But he watched. Closely.

During a short break, they sat near the corner wall, sipping nutrient fluid.
“I used to bring books to my neighbor’s kids,” Elijah said.
Rowan glanced sideways.
“Didn’t think anyone cared about books.”
“They didn’t. That’s why I did it.”
Elijah smiled, embarrassed.
“I hid them in food deliveries. Only ever got caught because one of the books had a tag I missed. Guess that makes me a subversive librarian.”
Rowan gave a dry grunt. It might have been a laugh.

That night, the lights dimmed with a soft chime—night mode settling like a hush across the room.
They both lay still for a long while.
Then Elijah whispered, barely audible.
“Are you ever going to open that book?”
Rowan didn’t answer immediately. Then:
“If I open it, I have to remember who I was.”
He would hear his own voice again later—different place, different moment—but the same truth, echoing back.
Elijah didn’t push.
They laid together in the dark, each in their own thoughts..

Later, Rowan sat upright for a while, elbows on knees, thinking.
Elijah reminded him of a young private he once trained—always tripping over gear, always too eager to impress. Rowan had trained dozens like him. Most didn’t last. But one did—a quiet kid from San Marcos who used to stutter when giving orders. He learned. Got sharp. Rowan never forgot the day that kid stepped in front of gunfire for his unit. Elijah wasn’t him. But there was something in the eyes—uncertain, but willing—that brought it all back. But tThere was something in Elijah’s clumsy defiance, his unfiltered kindness, that felt familiar.
It reminded Rowan of who he used to be. Before the war. Before the silence.
And in that moment, he didn’t see a civilian. He saw a soldier.
One worth protecting.
Just like the first man who ever believed in him—his squad leader. The one who said, "I'll be right behind you."

Sometime later, Rowan was still awake.
Elijah turned in his sleep. Mumbled something. A whimper, almost.
“Don’t… I didn’t mean… please…”
Rowan looked across the room at Elijah.
Didn’t say anything.
But he stayed awake a while longer.
Just in case.
He’d think of that same phrase later—when the world cracked open and someone needed covering. Just in case.
