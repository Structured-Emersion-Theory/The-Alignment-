## Chapter 5: Memory of Deployment ##

The sky was white with dust.
Rowan was on point. Young. Focused. Pretending not to be scared.
The soldiers walked behind him—tight formation. Five of them. Spread just close enough to cover each other. His responsibility.
They moved north, clearing a narrow alleyway off a sector they’d passed a dozen times before. Routine.
Rowan kept his eyes forward, mind alert. No chatter. Just the sound of boots, gear shifting, the faint clink of metal.
Then: a voice, steady and low.
“You’ve been doing real good, Rowan.”
He turned slightly. His squad leader—older, calm, the kind of man who didn’t waste words.
“I’m proud of you. You’re becoming the kind of man others follow. You ready?”
Rowan nodded. Just once.
“I’ll be right behind you. Let’s go clear the sector.”

Rowan stepped forward.
Then something changed.
The air went thin. Like the moment knew what was coming.
Panic set in—a memory painted in blood.

Rowan jolted awake.
His hands were clenched. Sheets damp with sweat.
The room was quiet. Elijah was still asleep.
He lay back, heart pounding, eyes fixed on the ceiling.
SCORN (faint): “You haven’t forgiven the part of you that survived.”
He didn’t move.
Didn’t speak.
The silence was heavier than the dream.
It always was.
