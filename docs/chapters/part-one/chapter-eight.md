## Chapter 8: Harmonized Citizenship ##

Rowan sat beneath the sterile white glow of the overhead lights, watching the schedule update on the wall display. The lines changed with clinical precision:
08:00 - Alignment Metrics and Self-Audit
09:15 - Harmonized Civics: Citizenship Through Contribution
10:45 - Advanced Compliance Ethics: Trust and Surveillance
12:00 - Lunch and Reflection
13:00 - Cognitive Correction Lab
15:00 - Role Assignment Simulation
He read the schedule twice and rubbed his eyes. “I don’t know how much I can take anymore,” he muttered under his breath.
The hallways smelled like sterilizers and were silent. His feet dragged as he followed the silent tide of other compliant learners—heads down, expressions smoothed out like river stones. When the classroom door slid shut behind him, the real title flickered on the wall:
Harmonized Civics: Preservation Through Sacrifice
A soft hum replaced the white noise. The instructor appeared—a projection of a serene, silver-haired figure with a voice like lullabies written by bureaucrats.
“Welcome. Today we explore the ethics of sacrifice. In the Pre-Harmony era, death was random. Wild. Inefficient. But Harmony required a recalibration of moral frameworks. Killing for the greater good is not murder—it is moral alignment.”
Rowan blinked slowly.
“We don’t need to kill anymore,” the instructor continued. “Because enough were silenced early enough that the rest learned to comply. Your obedience is the peace we preserve.”
Rowan’s jaw tightened. His knuckles whitened around the edge of his tablet. A graph appeared behind the avatar:
100,000 silenced to prevent 1,000,000 projected deaths from unrest.
“This is not a loss. This is optimization.”
The graph dissolved. Rowan’s vision faded.
He wasn’t watching a lesson. He was watching a lie.
Rowan was back in Fallujah. Or maybe Tikrit. Or maybe nowhere real—just a stitched-up memory of sand and flies and the stench of rotting flesh. Bodies left in the street. A boot print in blood. Something sweet and rancid thick in his throat.
He gagged. Stumbled to his feet.
“Restroom,” he muttered. Didn’t ask. Didn’t wait.
The hall outside was quiet. Cold. He found the nearest sink and leaned over it, trembling. Water ran. His breath hit the mirror and fogged half his face.
Why does it have to be this way? he thought. Why can’t they just be kind to each other?
A voice cut through the air. Dry. Familiar. Not from the intercom.
“Because kindness isn’t programmable. But obedience is.”
The voice felt like a memory. Like the ghost of a better instinct.
Rowan snapped upright. Turned. No one.
Then—
“Relax,” the voice said again. “I’m you. Just the part that still gives a damn.”
He stared at the empty air like it owed him an explanation.
“Go haunt someone else,” Rowan muttered, grabbing the towel. He wiped his face, then tossed it aside.
He walked out, mumbling to himself, “Guess I’m crazy now too. Hope I get a prize.”
As he sat back down, the lights flickered.
Tablets went dark.
Then Elijah’s screen lit up—his alone.
“I’m ready to show you.”
And then, as if nothing had happened, SAMA’s voice washed over the room.
“All systems harmonized. Thank you for your patience.”
Rowan turned his head slightly toward Elijah without speaking.
Elijah said quietly, “Did you see that?”
Rowan didn’t answer. They waited. The rest of the class resumed as if the flicker had been nothing. But the message was still there, burned behind their eyes.
That night, after their final assigned duties, Elijah didn’t go back to his bunk. He found Rowan instead.
Elijah leaned in, “It said ‘just leave.’”
Rowan stared at him. “What do you mean?”
“After the update. My tablet. It said, ‘Just leave.’ That’s it.”
Rowan considered the hallway—dim, sterile, empty.
They walked side by side through the administrative wing. No guards. No cameras following. No lockdown warnings. Doors opened automatically. Lights hummed politely.
Elijah, “Do we run?” 
Rowan, “We walk. If they’re watching, they already know.”
The last door was the only one that didn’t automatically open. Rowan reached for the handle, bracing for a shock, an alarm, a retinal scan. Nothing.
The door clicked. It wasn’t locked.
They stepped through.
Outside.
The wind was soft. There was no fence. No walls. Just trees. A road.
Rowan turned slowly. The building behind them glowed like a hospital at midnight. No one was coming after them.
Rowan looked panicked, “Has no one tried this before?”
Elijah, barely audible,“Or did they just want us to?”
They kept walking. The lights behind them didn’t blink. No searchlights. No drones. Just the quiet hum of something that had already moved on.
Like the building had already forgotten them.
