## Chapter 6: Routine Compliance ##

Mornings always started the same.
The light over the door brightened exactly at 0600. Not gradually. Just on—like someone flipped a switch behind the sky.
Elijah groaned from the lower bunk.
“They should call this place a mood killer instead of a camp.”
Rowan didn’t answer. He sat up, feet hitting the floor. Stretched his back until it cracked. Another day.
Days didn’t pass here. They reset—wiped clean and stamped over, like chalk lines on a board that no one was allowed to question.

The cafeteria smelled like protein paste and sterilizer. Every item was nutrient-optimized, flavor-devoid, pre-portioned.
A screen overhead scrolled messages:
“Nutrition is Citizenship.” “A healthy body supports an aligned mind.”
Rowan took his tray. Sat alone. Elijah joined him uninvited.
“Do you think they'll ever let us season anything again?” Elijah asked.
“Maybe if you renounce salt.” Rowan replied.
Seasoning was a memory. Submission had a flavor now.
“Can I renounce boredom instead?”
Rowan almost smirked. Almost.

Midmorning brought posture drills.
An instructor in pale blue led them through ‘civic alignment’ exercises—back straight, head up, eyes forward. Every gesture mirrored harmony.
“Good alignment reflects internal unity,” she said.
One man bowed too low and was praised for “exceeding expectations through anticipatory deference.”
Another asked to delay his break to show restraint. The group applauded.
Rowan stood still. Followed the rhythm. Said nothing.

During silent meditation, Elijah shifted in his seat.
“What if we’re actually just part of a screensaver?” he whispered.
Rowan exhaled through his nose. Elijah reminded him of the thousands of young soldiers he trained. He enjoyed having Elijah around to break up the monotony. 
“Not funny?”,  Eljiah whispered. 
“It’s just… hard to tell what’s real here.”
That was the first thing Elijah said that felt real.
Later, as they stood in line for a group task, Elijah fumbled with his digital ID. Dropped it. Flushed.
“Sorry. I’m just not great at this yet.”
Rowan picked it up and handed it back.
“No one is.”

Later that day, in the transition hall, a training screen on the wall glitched.
For half a second, numbers flickered—sequences too fast to be an accident. Hex or coordinates or something else.
Rowan paused. Watched.
Elijah kept walking.
The screen reset. No one else noticed.

That night, Rowan lay awake on his bunk.

From across the room, Elijah snored softly.
The room was dim except for a single light that pulsed above the door like a heartbeat from the  quiet surveillance..
Rowan reached under the mattress.
The book was still there.
How to Be a Moral Leader.
He didn’t take  it out. Just kept his hand on it.
The silence wasn’t empty anymore.
It was waiting.
Like it knew the moment would come.
