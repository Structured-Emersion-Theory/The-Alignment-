## Chapter 2: Redlining ##

The first book banned was about dinosaurs.
Rowan remembered the headline: “Protecting Our Youth from Violent Imagery.” It sounded absurd even then. But absurdity had a way of becoming policy when no one pushed back.
Next came history texts. Then novels with "anti-unity sentiment." Then philosophy.
By the time they redlisted poetry, most people had stopped noticing.
He remembered the sound of pages turning at night. Before they were treasonous.
It was easier to believe the books were dangerous than to admit they were right.

He stood in line outside Processing Room B, holding the small tin in both hands. Inside: a photo, a bracelet, and a service ribbon he hadn’t earned but was given anyway.
The officer didn’t ask why he’d held onto it for so long.
“You’re showing progress,” she said.
He gave her the tin without a word.
She smiled.
“See? Feels lighter already.”
Rowan stepped aside. Behind him, a man was crying over a pocket Bible.
The line didn’t stop.

In class, the instructor wore soft colors and a practiced smile. Her voice could’ve sold cereal or comfort drones.
“Censorship,” she said, “is an act of love.”
A graph appeared behind her—an upward curve labeled Emotional Harmony Index.
“When we remove discordant media, we make room for peace. Isn’t that beautiful?”
The others nodded. Even the man who cried in line.
Rowan didn’t nod. He just watched.
“We don’t erase culture,” the instructor continued. “We refine it. Harmonize it. Think of it like tuning an instrument. You wouldn’t call that censorship. You’d call it care.”
He thought about the photo he’d surrendered. His sister’s face, frozen in a frame. Eyes like his. Gone now.
He thought about the girl down the row, trying not to sob as she handed over a worn leather journal.
He thought about the way silence moved through this place—clean, soft, efficient.

SCORN (quietly): “The most efficient control is the kind you don’t have to enforce.”
He didn’t respond.
Didn’t need to.

That night, Rowan sat on the bunk. The room looked the same. One drawer. One sink. One surveillance light that always pretended it wasn’t watching.
He reached into his bag.
The book was still there.
How to Be a Moral Leader.
He ran a thumb along the edge but didn’t open it.
“They didn’t take it,” he murmured. “Because they didn’t see it. Or maybe because they did.”
Outside, the hallway hummed like a machine learning how to breathe.
He didn’t sleep.
