## Chapter 1: The Book ##

The intake room smelled like bleach and bureaucracy.
Rowan stood beneath flickering fluorescent lights, hands at his sides, waiting to be processed. The line inched forward like it had nowhere better to be. One by one, they stepped up, gave their name, and handed over their items.
The man in front of Rowan tried to keep his voice steady as he offered up an old photo. A child’s drawing. A chipped wedding ring.
The officer scanned each object in silence.
“Sentimental. Not aligned.”
A flash of red. The items dropped into the bin.
Rowan stepped forward.
“Name?”
“Rowan.”
“Full name?”
“Does it matter?”
The officer didn’t look up. Just tapped the screen.
“Bag.”
Rowan handed it over. The officer unzipped it with the kind of detachment reserved for lunchboxes and contraband.
Inside: a spare shirt. Toothbrush. His book.
How to Be a Moral Leader.
It felt heavier than paper should. Like memory had weight.
The officer paused for half a breath. His hand moved past it. Pulled out the shirt. Shook it loose. Scanned. Then zipped the bag closed.
“Room C-14. Bunk on the left. You’ll be called when it’s time.”
Rowan took the bag. Didn’t speak.

The hallway outside hummed with the quiet sound of compliance. No voices. Just shoes on tile. Cameras tracked, but didn’t follow. Doors opened and closed without resistance.
Posters lined the walls in soft pastels:
“Compliance is Peace.”
“Sacrifice is Order.”
“Harmony Through Surrender.”
Rowan paused in front of one. The image showed a family at a dinner table, smiling too broadly. The text beneath it read:
“It didn’t hurt to obey.”
He stared at it for a long time.
“That’s what made it dangerous,” he muttered.
A whisper echoed faintly in his mind. Not a voice, exactly. More like an afterthought.
“You still know better.”
He blinked. Looked around. No one.
“Great,” he said under his breath. “Going crazy already.”

The room was small. Two bunks. One empty.
He didn’t ask who the other bunk belonged to. It didn’t matter. Not yet.
He dropped his bag on the mattress, sat down, and unzipped it slowly.
There it was. Still there.
The book.
How to Be a Moral Leader.
He didn’t open it. Just stared.
It wasn’t just any book. It was the one he carried through deployment, the one his squad passed around like it meant something. Half philosophy, half field guide—his moral baseline written in ink. Not the state’s version. His.
The hum of the overhead light buzzed like it had something to say.
The silence wasn’t peace. It was containment.
“Before we traded truth for comfort,” he whispered.
He didn’t know why he said it. But it felt like the right place to start.
